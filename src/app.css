/* If you want your dark theme to be driven by a CSS selector instead of the prefers-color-scheme media query, override the dark variant to use your custom selector: */
@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));

/* How you add the dark class to the html element is up to you, but a common approach is to use a bit of JavaScript that updates the class attribute and syncs that preference to somewhere like localStorage. */
